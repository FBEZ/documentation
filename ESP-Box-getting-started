# Before starting
In this document we'll see how to flash your first program in the ESP32-S3-Box, the example ```image_display```.

## Prerequisites
To start compiling and flashing you need to have installed:
* ESP-IDF (here the v4.4 will be used)
* Vscode (not mandatory but highly recommended)

# Clonining the repo

The first step open a terminal and hit
```git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-box.git ```

It wil take some time.
